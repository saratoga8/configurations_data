Using expressions in string: #{...}
Array of words: a = %{ ant bee cat dog elk }
Unpredeclared constants: :some_const
Instead (0..6) use 7.times
Code block: { puts "here" } then called by yield
iterator: code called by yield for each element
& - for passing block as param
lambda { |params| ... } or -> params { ... } - storing block in var 
<=> - return 0, 1, -1
.eql? - with types compare
.equal? - objects ids R equals
a, b, c = 0, 2, 3
1...10 - from 1 to 9
